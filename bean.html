briefly what we're doing in the exercise-->
  <p>The name of my best food is <strong>beans</strong>
    and i'm going to be explaining in <em>details</em> how to
    go about this
  </p>
  <p>My recipes are as follows;</p>
  <!-- unordered lists -->
  <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>3 cigar cups (approx. 750g) brown/black eyed beans</li>
    <li>Red palm oil (enough to colour)</li>
    <li>Crayfish</li>
    <li>1 medium onion</li>
    <li>Salt & Maggi (for taste)</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
    <li>Water (ofcourse)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now lets get this cooking started shall we?</p>
  <p>Before you cook Beans</p>
  <!-- ordered lists -->
  <ol>
    <li>Soak the beans in cold water for 5 hours. 
    Boil the beans for 5 minutes and discard the water. 
    Wash the beans in cold water and set aside. 
    This soaking and pre-cooking process will help 
    reduce the gas inducing elements.
  </li>
    <li>Chop the onions, rinse and grind the crayfish and pepper.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Cooking Directions</p>
    <ol type="a">
    <li>Put the beans in a pot and pour water up 
      to the level of the beans and start cooking</li>
      <li>Cook till tender, adding more water from time to time, 
        if necessary. Always keep the water at the same level 
        as the beans so that when the beans is done,
         you will not have too much water in the porridge.</li>
      <li>When the beans porridge is soft, 
        add the onions, crayfish, 
        pepper and seasoning.</li>
      <li>Add the red palm oil, 
        salt to taste and cook for more 5 minutes on medium heat.</li>
      <li>Turn the porridge with a wooden spoon.</li>
     </ol>
  <p>The beans porridge is ready. This is best served with
    fried plantain/bread/garri/yam/fish.
